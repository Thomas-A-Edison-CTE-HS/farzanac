<h3>The Aurora Borealis</h3>
<p>The Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, is a natural light display predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around the Artic. </p>
<br>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>The process begins with solar winds—streams of charged particles released from the sun. When these particles reach the Earth, they interact with the planet's magnetic field. This interaction energizes atoms and molecules in the atmosphere, causing them to emit light in various colors, depending on the type of gas and its altitude:</p>

<h3>When and Where to See the Aurora</h3>
    <p>The best time to witness the Aurora Borealis is during winter, particularly from late September to early April. Ideal locations include:</p>
